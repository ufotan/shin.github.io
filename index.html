                <p>I'm Shin, a first year Computer Science and Physics student at the University of British Columbia. I'm currently looking for internship opportunities in Summer 2024. While my background in software development may be limited, I'm a problem solver with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms. Leveraging my past experiences and national team selections in competitive programming and linguistic olympiads, I have had the privilege to work on a diverse array of intellectually stimulating problems. These endeavors have not only bolstered my technical skills in algorithms and analytical thinking, but have also instilled in me the values of being resilient and persistent.

                    I love competitive programming. It's not just a test of coding proficiency, but also strategic thinking and adaptability. With a clock ticking for competitors from around the globe, the pressure is immeasurable. Yet, it's this very intensity that fuels the excitement and camaraderie among participants. In 2023, I placed 7th nationally in Malaysia, earning me a spot on the national team. Besides that, in my most recent contest, I ranked 856th globally in the Meta Hacker Cup, placing me top 4.2% among 20,324 participants. These awards show that I have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, affirming my proficiency in this aspect.</p>

                    I'm drawn to physics because it challenges me to think critically and solve problems, much like working on a puzzle. It's trains me to break down complex problems into manageable parts using logical thinking. This subject has also honed my analytical skills, which I find valuable in especially in the field of computer science. Moreover, I see physics as a key that unlocks the hidden truths of the world. It provides a framework to understand the fundamental principles governing the universe, and each discovery feels like a step closer to unraveling the mysteries of nature.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Computational linguistics is a not so well known field in the world of linguistics. In this field, linguists are given a few known translations of an unknown language. Then, linguists need to try to find out the structure and grammatical rules of the langauge, and translate the other unknown sentences. It's like a puzzle-solving game which requires a creative mind and strong analytical skills.
                    I absolutely fell in love with computational linguistics when I first learned about it. It's like decoding a secret language, and each discovery feels like a small victory. It has equipped me with invaluable skills in breaking down complex questions and thinking out of the box.
